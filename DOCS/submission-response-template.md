# New submission review

## Has the license been approved by the OSI?
*All OSI-approved license will be included on the SPDX License List, regardless of other factors*

## Definitive factors
*These must all be satisfied to allow inclusion in the license list*

### Is the submitted license unique, that is, it does not match another license already on the License List as per the matching guidelines?

### If a software license, does it apply to source code and not only to executables?

### Does the license have identifiable and stable text, and is not in the midst of drafting?

### Has the license steward, if any, committed to versioning new versions in the future and to not modify it after addition to the list?

## Other factors for inclusion
*Roughly in order of descending importance*

### 1. Does the license substantially comply with one of the free/open content definitions?
*Approval by the organisation that publishes the definition is not required*

### 2. Is the license structured to be generally usable by anyone, and not specific to one organisation or project?

### 3. Does the license have substantial use such that it is likely to be encountered (ie. use in many projects, or in one significant project)?
*For recently written licenses, definitive plans for it to be used in at least one or a few significant projects may satisfy this*

### 4. Is the license primarily intended to facilitate the free distribution of content with limited restrictions?

### 5. Does the license steward support this submission, or is at least aware of and not in opposition of it?

## Summary of factors / outcome
*Comments on the totality of these "other factors" in light of the SPDX License List's overall goals and objectives*
