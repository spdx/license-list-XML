* [SPDX License List Matching Guidelines](https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines) provides guidelines to be used for the purposes of matching licenses and license exceptions against those included on the SPDX License List.

* [SPDX Specification](https://spdx.org/specifications): It is helpful to be familiar with certain sections of the SPDX Specification thatuse or deal with the SPDX License List. In particular: sub-sections related to license information in Section 3, 4, and 6; Appendices II, IV, and V.
