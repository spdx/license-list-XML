      <p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE</p>
      <p>Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005</p>
    </title>
    <optional>
      <p>PREAMBLE</p>
      <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of cooperative font
         projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
         an open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
      <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they
         are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
         redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font names of derivative works are changed.
         The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license.</p>
