    This license has been voluntarily deprecated by its author.
    
    Per the copy of this license at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/HPND
    Explanation:
      * Angle brackets hold "fields", e.g. &lt;copyright holder&gt;.
      * Square brackets hold optional text, e.g. [or &lt;related entities&gt;].
      * A license can have variations in capitalization and whitespace, and still be considered an instance of this template.
    It may be possible to construct a grammatically incorrect license from this template, or one that lacks a disclaimer, or 
    one that includes a double-disclaimer. That is acceptable, as long as it remains impossible to construct a non-OSD-compliant 
    license that matches the pattern.
