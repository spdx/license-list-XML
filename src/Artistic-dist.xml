         This license is very similar to Artistic-1.0-Perl, but

            The "Artistic License"
         </titleText>
         <p>
            Preamble
         </p>
         <p>
            The intent of this document is to state the conditions under
            which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder
            maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development
            of the Package, while giving the users of the package the right
            to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
            fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
         </p>
         <p>
            It also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in
            your own programs without transferring this License to those
            programs, provided that you meet some reasonable requirements.
         </p>
         <p>
            Definitions:
         </p>
         <p>
            "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed
            by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that
            collection of files created through textual modification.
         </p>
         <p>
            "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not
            been modified, or has been modified in accordance with
            the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
         </p>
         <p>
            "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in
            the copyright or copyrights for the package.
         </p>
         <p>
            "You" is you, if you're thinking about
            copying or distributing this Package.
         </p>
         <p>
            "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
            basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people
            involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify
            it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
            community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
         </p>
         <p>
            "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the
            item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling
            the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
            redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.
         </p>
         <list>
            <item>
               <bullet>1.</bullet>
               You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source
               form of the Standard Version of this Package without
               restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the
               original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
            </item>
            <item>
               <bullet>2.</bullet>
               You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other
               modifications derived from the Public Domain or from
               the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a
               way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

               You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any
               way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each
               changed file stating how and when you changed that file,
               and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <bullet>a)</bullet>
                     place your modifications in the Public Domain
                     or otherwise make them Freely Available, such
                     as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
                     equivalent medium, or placing the modifications
                     on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or
                     by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
                     modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <bullet>b)</bullet>
                     use the modified Package only within
                     your corporation or organization.

                     rename any non-standard executables so the names do
                     not conflict with standard executables, which must
                     also be provided, and provide a separate manual
                     page for each non-standard executable that clearly
                     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

               You may distribute the programs of this Package
               in object code or executable form, provided
               that you do at least ONE of the following:
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <bullet>a)</bullet>
                     distribute a Standard Version of the executables and
                     library files, together with instructions (in the manual
                     page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <bullet>b)</bullet>
                     accompany the distribution with the machine-readable
                     source of the Package with your modifications.

                  <item>
                     <bullet>c)</bullet>
                     give non-standard executables non-standard
                     names, and clearly document the differences
                     in manual pages (or equivalent), together with
                     instructions on where to get the Standard Version.

               You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution
               of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support
               of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package
               itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate
               with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
               (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that
               you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

               The scripts and library files supplied as input to or
               produced as output from the programs of this Package do
               not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package,
               but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold
               commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
               If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
               Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of
               producing a binary executable image, then distribution of
               such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution
               of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of
               Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such
               an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.

               You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs,
               provided that you explicitly state where you got them from,
               in the source code (and, left to your courtesy, in the
               documentation), duplicating all the associated copyright notices
               and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be clearly
               marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under
               this license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no
               immediate connection with the name of the Package itself or its
               associated programs. You may then apply whatever restrictions you
               wish on the reused parts or choose to place them in the Public
               Domain--this will apply only within the context of your package.
