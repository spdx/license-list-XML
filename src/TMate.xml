          Redistributions in any form must be accompanied by information on how to obtain complete source
             code for the software that uses SVNKit and any accompanying software that uses the software
             that uses SVNKit. The source code must either be included in the distribution or be available
             for no more than the cost of distribution plus a nominal fee, and must be freely
             redistributable under reasonable conditions. For an executable file, complete source code
             means the source code for all modules it contains. It does not include source code for modules
             or files that typically accompany the major components of the operating system on which the
             executable file runs.
