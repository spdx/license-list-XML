         <p>
            BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING
            SIX TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.

               The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").

               Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software
               for any purpose, including commercial applications,
               free of charge and without payment of royalties,
               subject to the conditions and restrictions listed below.

               You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to
               others, and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your
               own software, on a world-wide, royalty-free basis. That
               portion of your distribution that does not consist of intact
               and unchanged copies of SOFA source code files is a "derived
               work" that must comply with the following requirements:

                     <bullet>a)</bullet>
                     Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that
                     it (i) uses routines and computations derived by
                     you from software provided by SOFA under license
                     to you; and (ii) does not itself constitute
                     software provided by and/or endorsed by SOFA.

                     <bullet>b)</bullet>
                     The source code of your derived work must contain
                     descriptions of how the derived work is based upon,
                     contains and/or differs from the original SOFA software.

                     <bullet>c)</bullet>
                     The names of all routines in your derived work shall
                     not include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial
                     modifications thereof such as changes of case.

                     The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
                     not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you wrote
                     the original software, nor file a patent application for
                     SOFA software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.

                     These requirements must be reproduced intact
                     in any source distribution and shall apply to
                     anyone to whom you have granted a further right
                     to modify the source code of your derived work.

                  Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software
                  is intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU
                  standards, and consequently third-party modifications
                  are discouraged. All variations, no matter how minor,
                  must be explicitly marked as such, as explained above.

               You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought
               into disrepute, either by misuse, or use for
               inappropriate tasks, or by inappropriate modification.

               The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no
               warranty as to its use or performance. SOFA does not and cannot
               warrant the performance or results which the user may obtain
               by using the SOFA software. SOFA makes no warranties, express
               or implied, as to non-infringement of third party rights,
               merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose. In no
               event will SOFA be liable to the user for any consequential,
               incidental, or special damages, including any lost profits
               or lost savings, even if a SOFA representative has been
               advised of such damages, or for any claim by any third party.

               under the terms and conditions specified herein
               does not imply that future versions will also be
               made available under the same terms and conditions.
