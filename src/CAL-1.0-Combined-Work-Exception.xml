<optional>## </optional><bullet>1. </bullet>Purpose
          <p>
This License gives You unlimited permission to use and modify the software to 
which it applies (the "Work"), either as-is or in modified form, for Your 
private purposes, while protecting the owners and contributors to the software 
from liability. 
          </p>
          <p>
This License also strives to protect the freedom and autonomy of third parties 
who receive the Work from you.  If any non-affiliated third party receives any 
part, aspect, or element of the Work from You, this License requires that You 
provide that third party all the permissions and materials needed to 
independently use and modify the Work without that third party having a loss 
of data or capability due to your actions. 
          </p>
          <p>
The full permissions, conditions, and other terms are laid out below.

<optional>## </optional><bullet>2. </bullet>Receiving a License
          <p>
In order to receive this License, You must agree to its rules. The rules of 
this License are both obligations of Your agreement with the Licensor and 
conditions to your License. You must not do anything with the Work that 
triggers a rule You cannot or will not follow. 
          </p>

            <item>
<optional>### </optional><bullet>2.1. </bullet>Application
              <p>
The terms of this License apply to the Work as you receive it from Licensor, 
as well as to any modifications, elaborations, or implementations created by 
You that contain any licensable portion of the Work (a "Modified Work"). 
Unless specified, any reference to the Work also applies to a Modified Work.

<optional>### </optional><bullet>2.2. </bullet>Offer and Acceptance
              <p>
This License is automatically offered to every person and organization. You 
show that you accept this License and agree to its conditions by taking any 
action with the Work that, absent this License, would infringe any 
intellectual property right held by Licensor. 
              </p>

            <item>
<optional>### </optional><bullet>2.3. </bullet> Compliance and Remedies
              <p>
Any failure to act according to the terms and conditions of this License 
places Your use of the Work outside the scope of the License and infringes the 
intellectual property rights of the Licensor. In the event of infringement, 
the terms and conditions of this License may be enforced by Licensor under the 
intellectual property laws of any jurisdiction to which You are subject. You 
also agree that either the Licensor or a Recipient (as an intended third-party 
beneficiary) may enforce the terms and conditions of this License against You 
via specific performance.

<optional>## </optional><bullet>4. </bullet>Conditions
          <p>
If You exercise any permission granted by this License, such that the Work, or 
any part, aspect, or element of the Work, is distributed, communicated, made 
available, or made perceptible to a non-Affiliate third party (a "Recipient"), 
either via physical delivery or via a network connection to the Recipient, You 
must comply with the following conditions: 
          </p>
          <list>
            <item>
<optional>### </optional><bullet>4.1. </bullet>Provide Access to Source Code
              <p>
Subject to the exception in section 4.4, You must provide to each Recipient a 
copy of, or no-charge unrestricted network access to, the Source Code 
corresponding to the Work ("Access"). 
              </p>
              <p>
The "Source Code" of the Work means the form of the Work preferred for making 
modifications, including any comments, configuration information, 
documentation, help materials, installation instructions, cryptographic seeds 
or keys, and any information reasonably necessary for the Recipient to 
independently compile and use the Source Code and to have full access to the 
functionality contained in the Work.

                  <p>
Network Access to the Notices and Source Code may be provided by You or by a 
third party, such as a public software repository, and must persist during the 
same period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to You under 
this License and for at least one year thereafter.

<optional>#### </optional><bullet>4.1.2. </bullet>Source Code for a Modified Work
                  <p>
Subject to the exception in section 4.5, You must provide to each Recipient of 
a Modified Work Access to Source Code corresponding to those portions of the 
Work remaining in the Modified Work as well as the modifications used by You 
to create the Modified Work. The Source Code corresponding to the 
modifications in the Modified Work must be provided to the Recipient either 
a) under this License, or b) under a Compatible Open Source License.
                  </p>
                   <p>
A “Compatible Open Source License” means a license accepted by the Open Source 
Initiative that allows object code created using both Source Code provided under 
this License and Source Code provided under the other open source license to be 
distributed together as a single work.

              <p>
In addition to providing each Recipient the opportunity to have Access to the 
Source Code, You cannot use the permissions given under this License to 
interfere with a Recipient's ability to fully use an independent copy of the 
Work generated from the Source Code You provide with the Recipient's own User 
Data.
              </p>
              <p>
"User Data" means any data that is an input to or an output from the Work, 
where the presence of the data is necessary for substantially identical use of 
the Work in an equivalent context chosen by the Recipient, and where the 
Recipient has an existing ownership interest, an existing right to possess, or 
where the data has been generated by, for, or has been assigned to the 
Recipient.

                  <p>
Throughout any period in which You exercise any of the permissions granted to 
You under this License, You must also provide to any Recipient to whom you 
provide services via the Work, a no-charge copy, provided in a commonly used 
electronic form, of the Recipient's User Data in your possession, to the 
extent that such User Data is available to You for use in conjunction with the 
Work.

                  <p>
You may not, by means of the use cryptographic methods applied to anything 
provided to the Recipient, by possession or control of cryptographic keys, 
seeds, hashes, by any other technological protection measures, or by any other 
method, limit a Recipient's ability to access any functionality present in 
Recipient's independent copy of the Work, or to deny a Recipient full control 
of the Recipient's User Data.

<optional>#### </optional><bullet>4.2.3. </bullet>No Legal or Contractual Measures that Limit Access
                  <p>
You may not contractually restrict a Recipient's ability to independently 
exercise the permissions granted under this License. You waive any legal power 
to forbid circumvention of technical protection measures that include use of 
the Work, and You waive any claim that the capabilities of the Work were 
limited or modified as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third parties 
against Recipients.

              <p>
You must retain all licensing, authorship, or attribution notices contained in 
the Source Code (the "Notices"), and provide all such Notices to each 
Recipient, together with a statement acknowledging the use of the Work. 
Notices may be provided directly to a Recipient or via an easy-to-find 
hyperlink to an Internet location also providing Access to Source Code.

              <p>
You are required to uphold the conditions of this License only relative to 
those who are Recipients of the Work from You. Other than providing Recipients 
with the applicable Notices, Access to Source Code, and a copy of and full 
control of their User Data, nothing in this License requires You to provide 
processing services to or engage in network interactions with anyone.

              <p>
As an exception to condition that You provide Recipients Access to Source 
Code, any Source Code files marked by the Licensor as having the "Combined 
Work Exception," or any object code exclusively resulting from Source Code 
files so marked, may be combined with other Software into a "Larger Work." So 
long as you comply with the requirements to provide Recipients the applicable 
Notices and Access to the Source Code provided to You by Licensor, and you 
provide Recipients access to their User Data and do not limit Recipient's 
ability to independently work with their User Data, any other Software in the 
Larger Work as well as the Larger Work as a whole may be licensed under the 
terms of your choice.

The term of this License begins when You receive the Work, and continues until 
terminated for any of the reasons described herein, or until all Licensor's 
intellectual property rights in the Software expire, whichever comes first 
("Term"). This License cannot be revoked, only terminated for the reasons 
listed below.

              <p>
If this License is terminated for any reason, all permissions granted to You 
under Section 3 by any Licensor automatically terminate. You will immediately 
cease exercising any permissions granted in this License relative to the Work, 
including as part of any Modified Work. 
              </p>

            <item>
<optional>### </optional><bullet>5.2. </bullet>Termination for Non-Compliance; Reinstatement
              <p>
This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with any of the 
conditions in section 4. As a special exception to termination for 
non-compliance, Your permissions for the Work under this License will 
automatically be reinstated if You come into compliance with all the 
conditions in section 2 within sixty (60) days of being notified by Licensor 
or an intended third-party beneficiary of Your noncompliance. You are eligible 
for reinstatement of permissions for the Work one time only, and only 
for the sixty days immediately after becoming aware of noncompliance. Loss of 
permissions granted for the Work under   this License due to either a) 
sustained noncompliance lasting  more than sixty days or b) subsequent 
termination for  noncompliance after reinstatement, is permanent, unless 
rights are specifically restored by Licensor in writing.

              <p>
If You initiate litigation against Licensor, or any Recipient of the Work, 
either direct or indirect, asserting that the Work directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then all permissions granted to You by this License 
shall terminate. In the event of termination due to litigation, all 
permissions validly granted by You under this License, directly or indirectly, 
shall survive termination. Administrative review procedures, declaratory 
judgment actions, counterclaims in response to patent litigation, and 
enforcement actions against former Licensees terminated under this section do 
not cause termination due to litigation.

As far as the law allows, the Work comes AS-IS, without any warranty of any 
kind, and no Licensor or contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages 
related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim, or 
for any type of damages, including indirect, special, incidental, or

              <p>
An "Affiliate" means any other entity that, directly or indirectly through one 
or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control 
with, the Licensee. Employees of a Licensee and natural persons acting as 
contractors exclusively providing services to Licensee are also Affiliates.

              <p>
A Licensor may require that any action or suit by a Licensee relating to a 
Work provided by Licensor under this License may be brought only in the courts 
of a particular jurisdiction and under the laws of a particular jurisdiction 
(excluding its conflict-of-law provisions), if Licensor provides conspicuous 
notice of the particular jurisdiction to all Licensees.

              <p>
This License is not sublicensable. Each time You provide the Work or a 
Modified Work to a Recipient, the Recipient automatically receives a license 
under the terms described in this License. You may not impose any further 
reservations, conditions, or other provisions on any Recipients' exercise of 
the permissions granted herein.

              <p>
In any action to enforce the terms of this License, or seeking damages 
relating thereto, including by an intended third-party beneficiary, the 
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, 
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred 
in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. A 
"prevailing party" is the party that achieves, or avoids, compliance with this 
License, including through settlement. This section shall survive the 
termination of this License.

            <item>
<optional>### </optional><bullet>7.5. </bullet>No Waiver
              <p>
Any failure by Licensor to enforce any provision of this License will not 
constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit Licensor's 
ability to enforce such provision at a later time.

              <p>
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any 
invalid or unenforceable portion will be interpreted to the effect and intent 
of the original portion. If such a construction is not possible, the invalid 
or unenforceable portion will be severed from this License but the rest of 
this License will remain in full force and effect.
