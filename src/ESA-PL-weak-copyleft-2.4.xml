                  While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may

                  charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity,
                  liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided
                  such additional agreements are consistent with this License
                  and do not effectively restrict the recipient’s rights under
                  this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                  act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
                  not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only
                  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                  or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                  asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of
                  your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  receiving a third party notification of infringement)
                  would expose you to the risk of being considered as
                  intentionally infringing third party rights. In such
