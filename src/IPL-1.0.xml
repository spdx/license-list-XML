          <b>b.</b>
          <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
            <br/>grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
            <br/>license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
            <br/>import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, 
            <br/>if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license 
            <br/>shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program 
            <br/>if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such 
            <br/>addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by 
            <br/>the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any 
            <br/>other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per 
            <br/>se is licensed hereunder.

          <b>c.</b>
          <p>Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
            <br/>licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
            <br/>provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
            <br/>patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. 
            <br/>Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims 
            <br/>brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual 
            <br/>property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the 
            <br/>rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes 
            <br/>sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights 
            <br/>needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is 
            <br/>required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is 
            <br/>Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before 
            <br/>distributing the Program.

          <p>Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has

              <br/>manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

          <p>Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:</p>
          <p>Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.</p>
          <p>In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator

            <br/>subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

          <b>4.</b>
          <p>COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION 
            <br/>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
            <br/>responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
            <br/>like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial 
            <br/>use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
            <br/>commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
            <br/>create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
            <br/>Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
            <br/>such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend 
            <br/>and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") 
            <br/>against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
            <br/>from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third 
            <br/>party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the 
            <br/>acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with 
            <br/>its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. 
            <br/>The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
            <br/>relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
            <br/>In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
            <br/>notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
            <br/>allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
            <br/>Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
            <br/>negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any 
            <br/>such claim at its own expense. 
          </p>
          <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
            <br/>product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
            <br/>Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
            <br/>claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
            <br/>claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
            <br/>responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor 
            <br/>would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to 
            <br/>those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any 
            <br/>other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial 
            <br/>Contributor must pay those damages.

          <p>NO WARRANTY

            <br/>OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
            <br/>responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
            <br/>distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
            <br/>exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to 
            <br/>the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
            <br/>laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and

      <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with 
        <br/>respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim 
        <br/>or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by 
        <br/>that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall 
        <br/>terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if 
        <br/>Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including

        <br/>itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or 
        <br/>hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's

        <br/>rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        <br/>and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        <br/>However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any 
        <br/>licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue

      <p>IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement 
        <br/>from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        <br/>distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        <br/>may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        <br/>under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        <br/>Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        <br/>Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one 
        <br/>other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as 
        <br/>expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives 
        <br/>no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
        <br/>under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
        <br/>otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under

      <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        <br/>the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        <br/>party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this 
        <br/>Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each 
        <br/>party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.
