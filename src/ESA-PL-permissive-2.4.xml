                  hardware, unless such combination was an intended use case of
                  the Patent Licensed Version (e.g. a general purpose library
                  is intended to be used with other software, a satellite
                  navigation software is intended to be used with appropriate
                  hardware); or · by a Modification under Patent Claims in the

                  While Distributing the Software or Modifications, You may
                  choose to conclude additional agreements, for free or for
                  charge, regarding for example support, warranty, indemnity,
                  liability or liability obligations and/or rights, provided
                  such additional agreements are consistent with this License
                  and do not effectively restrict the recipient’s rights under
                  this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                  act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
                  not on behalf of any other Contributor or Licensor, and only
                  if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
                  or Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
                  asserted against, such Contributor or Licensor by reason of
                  your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                  You acknowledge that continuing to use the Software knowing
                  that such use infringes third party rights (e.g. after
                  receiving a third party notification of infringement)
                  would expose you to the risk of being considered as
                  intentionally infringing third party rights. In such
                  event You should acquire the respective rights or modify
                  the Software so that the Modification is non-infringing.

                  alleging that the Software constitutes direct or contributory
