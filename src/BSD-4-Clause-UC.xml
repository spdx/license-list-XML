  <notes>This is the same license as the BSD-4-Clause, but with a copyright notice for the Regents of the University
         of California. Captures the retroactive deletion of the third (advertising) clause of the Original BSD
         license for BSD-licensed code developed by UC Berkeley and its contributors (see
         ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change)</notes>
