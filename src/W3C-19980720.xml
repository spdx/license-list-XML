         <p>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on August 14 1998 so as to improve
         compatibility with GPL. This version ensures that W3C software licensing terms are no more restrictive
         than GPL and consequently W3C software may be distributed in GPL packages. See the older formulation
         for the policy prior to this date. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions about using
         materials from our site, including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and
         Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be directed to site-policy@w3.org.</p>
