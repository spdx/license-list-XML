                   Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone

                   not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
                   structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant

                   do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any

                   indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
                   indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred

                   this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
                   obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                   notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
                   describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
                   Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
                   contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
                   with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version
                   does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code

                   that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the

                 to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
                 more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
                 not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
                 clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
                 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
                 Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
                 a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

          <b>3.6.</b>
          <p>Distribution of Executable Versions. 
            <br/>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
                 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
                 the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
                 License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
                 of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
                 Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
                 recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable
                 version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                 different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
                 this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
                 or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth
                 in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license
                 You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
                 offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby
                 agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
                 incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
                 You offer.

          <p>Larger Works. 
            <br/>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
                 terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
                 case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                 Covered Code.

            <br/>If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular
                 functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text
                 file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
                 the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
                 contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as
                 described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You
                 make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
                 mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
                 Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

            <br/>Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions

          <p>Effect of New Versions. 
            <br/>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
                 always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use
                 such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published
                 by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable
                 to Covered Code created under this License.

                 apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you must
                 (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'',
                 ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your
                 license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains
                 terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
