         <p>Allegro 4 (the giftware license)</p>
      </titleText>
    
      <p>Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in cooperation, and is given to you
         freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like,
         and you do not have to give us anything in return.</p>
      <p>However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the Allegro
         community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful bug report, making an
         improvement to the library, or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that other people
         can learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, it would be nice
         if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you
         not to abuse our generosity.</p>
