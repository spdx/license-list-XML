      <p>As a special exception, you may use this file as part of a free
         software library without restriction. Specifically, if other
         files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions
         from this file, or you compile this file and link it with
         other files to produce an executable, this file does not by
         itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU
         General Public License. This exception does not however
         invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be
         covered by the GNU General Public License.</p>
