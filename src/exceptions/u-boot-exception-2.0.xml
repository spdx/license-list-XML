      <p>The U-Boot License Exception:</p>
    </title>
    <body>
      <p>Even though U-Boot in general is covered by the GPL-2.0/GPL-2.0+,
         this does *not* cover the so-called "standalone" applications
         that use U-Boot services by means of the jump table provided
         by U-Boot exactly for this purpose - this is merely considered
         normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the heading of
         "derived work".</p>
      <p>The header files "include/image.h" and
         "arch/*/include/asm/u-boot.h" define interfaces to U-Boot. 
         Including these (unmodified) header files in another file is
         considered normal use of U-Boot, and does *not* fall under the
         heading of "derived work".
