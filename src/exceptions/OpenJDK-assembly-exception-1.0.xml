      <p>
         The OpenJDK source code made available by Oracle America, Inc.
         (Oracle) at openjdk.java.net ("OpenJDK Code") is distributed
         under the terms of the GNU General Public License
         &lt;http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html&gt; version 2 only
         ("GPL2"), with the following clarification and special
         exception.
      </p>

      <list>
         <item>
            <p>Linking this OpenJDK Code statically or dynamically with
               other code is making a combined work based on this
               library. Thus, the terms and conditions of GPL2 cover the
               whole combination.
            </p>

            <p>As a special exception, Oracle gives you permission to
               link this OpenJDK Code with certain code licensed by
               Oracle as indicated at
               http://openjdk.java.net/legal/exception-modules-2007-05-08.html
               ("Designated Exception Modules") to produce an
               executable, regardless of the license terms of the
               Designated Exception Modules, and to copy and distribute
               the resulting executable under GPL2, provided that the
               Designated Exception Modules continue to be governed by
               the licenses under which they were offered by Oracle.
            </p>
         </item>
      </list>

      <p>As such, it allows licensees and sublicensees of Oracle's GPL2
         OpenJDK Code to build an executable that includes those
         portions of necessary code that Oracle could not provide under
         GPL2 (or that Oracle has provided under GPL2 with the Classpath
         exception). If you modify or add to the OpenJDK code, that new
         GPL2 code may still be combined with Designated Exception
         Modules if the new code is made subject to this exception by
         its copyright holder.
