      <notes>Specified to be associated with LGPL-2.0. On Fedora List as "FLTK License".</notes>
      <p>The FLTK library and included programs are provided under the
         terms of the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL) with
         the following exceptions:</p>
      <p>Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config header file,
         and makefiles by themselves to support a specific platform do
         not constitute a modified or derivative work.</p>
      <p>The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to
         the FLTK project - send all contributions to
         "fltk-bugs@fltk.org".</p>
      <p>Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not constitute a
         derivative work.</p>
      <p>Static linking of applications and widgets to the FLTK library
         does not constitute a derivative work and does not require the
         author to provide source code for the application or widget,
         use the shared FLTK libraries, or link their applications or
         widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.</p>
      <p>If you link the application or widget to a modified version of
         FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be provided under the
         terms of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.</p>
      <p>You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with
         programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you have
         to identify the FLTK license in your program or documentation
         as required by section 6 of the LGPL.</p>
      <p>However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK. The
         following example statement can be included in user
         documentation to satisfy this requirement:</p>
      <p>[program/widget] is based in part on the work of the FLTK project
         (http://www.fltk.org).</p>
