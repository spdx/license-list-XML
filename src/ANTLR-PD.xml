        or the code generated by 
        <alt match="ANTLR|PCCTS" name="ANTLR3">ANTLR</alt>,

      <p>We encourage users to develop software with 
        <alt match="ANTLR|PCCTS" name="ANTLR5">ANTLR</alt>. 
        However, we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
        <alt match="ANTLR|PCCTS" name="ANTLR6">ANTLR</alt>. 
        By "credit", we mean that if you
        <optional> use ANTLR or </optional>
        incorporate
        <alt match="any|our" name="source">any</alt>
        source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) 
        that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like 
        <alt match="ANTLR|PCCTS" name="ANTLR7">ANTLR</alt> 
        and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using 
        <alt match="ANTLR|PCCTS" name="ANTLR8">ANTLR</alt>. 
        In addition, we ask that 
        <alt match="the|this" name="article">the</alt> 
        <alt match="headers|header" name="headers">headers</alt>  
        remain intact in our source code. 
        As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make 
        other tools available as they are completed.</p>
