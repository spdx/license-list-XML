The MirOS Licence

Copyright [YEAR]
[NAME] [EMAIL]

Provided that these terms and disclaimer and all copyright notices are retained or reproduced in an accompanying document, permission is granted to deal in this work without restriction, including unlimited rights to use, publicly perform, distribute, sell, modify, merge, give away, or sublicence.

This work is provided "AS IS" and WITHOUT WARRANTY of any kind, to the utmost extent permitted by applicable law, neither express nor implied; without malicious intent or gross negligence. In no event may a licensor, author or contributor be held liable for indirect, direct, other damage, loss, or other issues arising in any way out of dealing in the work, even if advised of the possibility of such damage or existence of a defect, except proven that it results out of said person's immediate fault when using the work as intended.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To apply the template[1] specify the years of copyright (separated by comma, not as a range), the legal names of the copyright holders, and the real names of the authors (and licensors, possibly) if different. Avoid adding any text that could be read as further restriction.

RATIONALE:
This licence is apt for any kind of work (such as source code, fonts, documentation, graphics, sound etc.) and the preferred terms for work added to MirBSD. It has been drafted as universally usable equivalent of the "historic permission notice"[2] adapted to Europen law because some countries have specific requirements for disclaimers, and author and licensor can differ in (droit d'auteur) legislations. The licence conforms to DFSG[3] 1.1, OKD[4] 2.1, OSD[5] 1.9, CSD[6], qualifies as a Free Software[7] and Free Documentation[8] licence, for Free Cultural Works[9], and is thus included in relevant lists[10] of licences. It's also a licence suitable for OER and Open Content[18].

The webpage[19] for this licence contains further information as well as additional resources such as translations.
